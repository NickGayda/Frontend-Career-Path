A color scheme generator webpage built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to practice using APIs and to be able to correctly parse through the returned data. The concept of the webpage is to select the color you want to use, the type of scheme, and the number of colors returned (4-7). The code will then fetch the data from The Color API and display it. 

This project was built from scratch and my only guidance was the image and Figma file provided below.
