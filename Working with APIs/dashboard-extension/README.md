A personal dashboard chrom extension built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This extension makes a new tab default to the personal dashboard page. This project interacts with the unsplash API to generate the background image,
the CoinGecko API to access crypto data, and the OpenWeather API to access the users current weather at their geolocation.
