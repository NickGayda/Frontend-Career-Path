An example coworking space site built with HTML and CSS to learn more CSS concepts.

Note: Was built on thinner browser window. Images do not look great on a full sized browser.

Web page is hosted here. https://coworking-space-nickgayda.netlify.app/

Concepts learned from this project:

    margin: auto on flex children

    position: absolute & relative

    align-self

    position: fixed
