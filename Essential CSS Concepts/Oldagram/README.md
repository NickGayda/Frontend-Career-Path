An Instagram clone called Oldagram that is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The orginal goal of this solo project was to sharpen my CSS skills. I completed the stretch goals as well, which included some JavaScript code. The page is dynamically built with JavaScript, so it is easy to add more posts if wanted. I also added a like feature, where you can like/unlike a post by double clicking the photo or by clicking the like button. I was given a Figma template and goals for completing this project.

Web page is hosted here.
