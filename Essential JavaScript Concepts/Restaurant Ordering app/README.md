A restaurant ordering app that is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to use the new JavaScript concepts learned from previous lessons. This app allows the user to add/remove the food items from their cart and simulate completing a purchase. The HTML for the food items is rendered out dynamically in the JavaScript and is loaded in from the data.js file. I completed the goals for this project in the image below, and added a couple of my own features. I added to ability to continue to do another order after an initial order is completed. For the payment pop up, I added an overlay, so the background items could not be interacted with and I also allow for the user to back out of the payment pop up with the 'X' at the top right.

The project was built from scratch and my only guidance was the image and Figma file provided below.
