A basketball scoreboard solo project built to implement newly learned JavaScript functionalities. An image of the desired project was provided and I was expected to build the page using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I was also given a template on Figma that I could use to judge element size and spacing.

Provided Figma design: https://www.figma.com/file/YC48MCx4frBFtYoz6rNJE6/Basketball-Scoreboard?node-id=126%3A14&mode=dev

Web page is hosted here. https://basketball-scoreboard-nickgayda.netlify.app/

Below is the image that was provided for the project.
