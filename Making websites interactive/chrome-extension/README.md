A URL saving chrome extension built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This extension was built throughout the course and used to show JavaScript functionalities. It utilizes local storage to be able to save the urls even when the tab is closed or refreshed.

The SAVE INPUT button will save the input url in the textbox. The SAVE TAB button will save the current tab to the list. The DELETE ALL button will delete all the save urls with a DOUBLE CLICK.
