A unit converter solo project built to implement newly learned JavaScript functionalities. An image of the desired project was provided and I was expected to build the page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I was also given a template on Figma that I could use to judge element size and spacing. I followed the guidelines to make this a functional unit converter and I added a feature to make sure only valid numbers are converted.

Provided Figma design: https://www.figma.com/file/cqtGul0V8RFXY4vTcIv1Kc/Unit-Conversion?node-id=41105%3A1268&mode=dev

Web page is hosted here. https://unit-converter-nickgayda.netlify.app/

Below is the image that was provided for the project.
