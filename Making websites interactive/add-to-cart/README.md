A shopping list application that uses a realtime database with Firebase and can be used as a personal mobile app. This application was built throughout the course and used to show JavaScript functionalities and interact with my first realtime database.

To use the app you simply type out which item you want to add to your shopping list, and hit add to cart! To delete the item, you click on it and it will be removed.
