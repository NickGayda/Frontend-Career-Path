A password generator solo project built to implement newly learned JavaScript functionalities. An image of the desired project was provided and I was expected to build the page using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I was also given a template on Figma that I could use to judge element size and spacing. I followed the guidelines and also added a bonus functionality that allows for the user to click on the passwords to copy them to their clipboard!

Provided Figma design: https://www.figma.com/file/NEj9JDycMjF3XKXq7swoc9/Random-Password-Generator-(New-version)?node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev

Web page is hosted here. https://password-generator-nickgayda.netlify.app/

Below is the image that was provided for the project.
