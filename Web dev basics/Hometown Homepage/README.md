The final solo project in the Learn HTML and CSS course. This project put together every learned in the course into one. An image of the desired project was provided and I was expected to build the page using HTML and CSS. I was also given a template on Figma that I could use to judge element size and spacing.

Provided Figma design: https://www.figma.com/file/2QuGfAOcHaZJ6aHXfuamnK/Hometown-Homepage?node-id=0%3A1&mode=dev
