A solo project to implement what was learned through the CSS portion of the course. An image of the desired project was provided and I was expected to build the page using HTML and CSS. 

NOTE: This webpage was built to look good at around 1000px width. Using percentages in CSS styling has not been learned yet.

Web page is hosted here. https://web-agency-hero-nickgayda.netlify.app/

Below is the image that was provided for the project.
