An extension of a previous webpage that was built earlier in the career path. The page was initially built with static elements and no responsive design. Throughout this lesson, I learned how to add responsive design and adjusted this site to be a mobile-first layout.

Webpage is hosted here: https://nft-site-responsive-nickgayda.netlify.app/

Concepts learned from this project:

    Think "responsively"

    Percentage, em, and rem

    Media queries and mobile-first

    flex-wrap and gap

    flex-basis, flex-grow, and flex
