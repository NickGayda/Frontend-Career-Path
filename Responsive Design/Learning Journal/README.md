An example learning journal layout built with HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to practice the new reponsive CSS tools I learned from the previous lessons. The desired outcome of this project was to customize it with personal information, but I plan on making something similar in the future in a different style. So, for this project, I just made sure I was able to do the responsive parts of the project.

This project was built from scratch and my only guidance was the image and Figma file provided below.
